## Why am I writing
I've been meaning to create a blog for many years. My previous attempts have gone by the wayside, mainly due to my interest levels fluctuating. I thought I had some amazing stuff to say in the past, and my attempts to turn this into words didn't meet my standards. I ended up suffering from writers block. I've finally got to the age where I can use the lessons my father Brian taught me around writers block. Start writing, just start. The only way you get something of value is with a concept or an idea. I'm writing this blog for two main reasons:

1. To help me understand my thoughts and keep a record of my views and how they evolve.
2. I have had the privilege of working with some amazing people in my career.

## So who am I?

I am married to a wonderful person called Nicole, who is creative in her own right. She is channeling this into becoming a potter. I'll share some examples of her work in future (probably in a post about Flow). I have 4 kids that have all of my personality and with their powers combined they will take on the planet. As I write this they are baking some cupcakes, and talking about comics, movies, video games, and making up stories. I'll write a post soon about my career history, but for now all you need to know is that I am currently an Architect and Software Developer working in Hamilton, New Zealand. I do not plan to talk about any of my employers by name, except when it is important to the story.
