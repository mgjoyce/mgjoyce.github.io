## Some companies believe that software is inert. 

CI is so important. I think back to some software that a team I was working with was developing, they had been pushed to code features and workflow for months on end, with no-one responsible for delivery. In fact deliver responsibility fell to SAFe. All activities were couching in terms of PIs ... the result of leaving so much softare un-integrated and untested is unpredictable timelines, for UAT, Deployment, and Release.


## Why did I write this?
