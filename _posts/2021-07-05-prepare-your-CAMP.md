If you haven't heard of [Daniel Pink](https://www.danpink.com/) or his book [Drive](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/) I recommend reading the book or watch this [TED talk](https://youtu.be/rrkrvAUbU9Y). Daniel talks about Motivation being built on Autonomy, Mastery[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) and Purpose.


I was reflecting this week about how difficult it was to connect with some of my work. I had too many things to do and lots of priority 1 tasks. It should have been easy to prioritise them right and concentrate on the highest priority. I have often talked about Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose after hearing Daniel talk about them. I realised it didn't help when I was overwhelmed by a lack of time. I first though of TAMPing down work to a manageable level. However growing up in New Zealand resulted in me thikning about CAMPing, Camps are awesome places. They are where you get away from things, you often have a single purpose, you choose who is with you, and you often have a fire. So I changed it from TAMP to CAMP. In this case C is for Capacity. 

**Capacity**, Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose (CAMP)

## Capacity
Do I have enough energy and time to do this justice? Can I find enough time to dedicate to getting into a [flow state](http://www.devx.com/DevX/Article/11659/). I want to be able to complete things. 

## Autonomy
Do I have a clear path to success? I want and expect challenges, problems, even roadblocks. These are the things that make my job fun, it's the intellectual stimulation that tells me I am doing something difficult enough to matter. 

There are warning signs:
- [False Ownership](/blog/2021/XX/XX/false-ownership)
- Lack of sponsorship to overcome roadblocks e.g. lack of organisational support or money

## Mastery
Am I sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable to tackle the challenge, or grow enough to meet the expectations of those who have asked me to help.

## Purpose
Is what I'm doing valuable to remain important to myself or the organisation through to completion? 

## Does this fit in my CAMP?

So I ask you, does your individual or team CAMP have room for what someone is asking from you. If not, then work out which of the four aspects is the problem. Use it as a tool to help you understand why saying No is O.K, and importantly to have fact based discussions with others.

Please let me know if this works for you, and if you learn anything from the idea.
