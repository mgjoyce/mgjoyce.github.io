If you haven't heard of [Daniel Pink](https://www.danpink.com/) or his book [Drive](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/) I recommend reading the book or watch this [TED talk](https://youtu.be/rrkrvAUbU9Y).

Daniel talks about Motivation being built on Autonomy, Mastery[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) and Purpose.

This post builds on his thoughts. I was reflecting this week about how difficult it was to connect with some of my work. I had too many things to do, too many priority 1 tasks. It should have been easy to prioritise them right!. Well I had two constraints time and value/priority. Still this wasn't enough to get focused. I started to think about Daniel's book. I realised that the ideas around motivation, combined with a assessment of something to do with "enough time" were what I was think of. I initially thought of TAMP (Time, Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose), but quickly realised Capacity felt better. It also results in a catchier acronym.

So CAMP it is: **Capacity**, Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose

### Capacity
Do I have enough energy and time to do this justice? Can I find enough time to dedicate to getting into a [flow state](http://www.devx.com/DevX/Article/11659/). I want to be able to complete things. 

### Autonomy
Do I have a clear path to success? I want and expect challenges, problems, even roadblocks. These are the things that make my job fun, it's the intellectual stimulation that tells me I am doing something difficult enough to matter. 

There are warning signs:
- [False Ownership](/blog/2021/XX/XX/false-ownership)
- Lack of sponsorship to overcome roadblocks e.g. lack of organisational support or money

### Mastery
Am I sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable to tackle the challenge, or grow enough to meet the expectations of those who have asked me to help.

### Purpose
Is what I'm doing valuable to remain important to myself or the organisation through to completion? 

### Does this fit in my CAMP?


So I'd ask you, does your individual or team CAMP have room for what someone is asking of you. If not, then work out which of the four aspects is the problem. Use it as a tool to help you understand why saying No is O.K, and importantly to have fact based discussions with others.
