If you haven't heard of [Daniel Pink](https://www.danpink.com/) or his book [Drive](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/) I recommend reading the book or watch this [TED talk](https://youtu.be/rrkrvAUbU9Y).

Daniel talks about Postive Motivation being built on Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.

This post builds on his thoughts. I was reflecting this week about how difficult it was to connect with some of my work. I had too many things to do, too many priority 1 tasks. It should have been easy to prioritise them right!. Well I had two constraints time and value/priority. Still this wasn't enough to get focused. I started to think about Daniel's book. I realised that the ideas around motivation, combined with a assessment of something to do with "enough time" were what I was think of. I initially thought of TAMP (Time, Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose), but quickly realised Capacity felt better. It also results in a catchier acronym. So CAMP it is.

1. Capacity

2. Autonomy
3. Mastery
4. Purpose



So I'd ask you, does you inidviual or team CAMP have room for what someone is asking of you. If not, then work out which of the four aspects is the problem.
